Light API Doc (BETA)
====================

The GeoAdmin Light API is in BETA state. Don't hesitate to provide feedback.

The GeoAdmin Light API is using only OpenLayers as based client library. This allows the creation of a small API but containing less functions than the GeoAdmin API based on ExtJS, GeoExt and OpenLayers.
The CSS is also less intrusive.
