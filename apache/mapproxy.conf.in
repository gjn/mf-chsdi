# The Apache mod_wsgi configuration file for MapProxy.

# We use mod_wsgi's daemon mode. And we assign a specific process
# group to the WSGI application.

# Note: once we use mod_wsgi 3 we'll be able to get rid of the
# Location block by passing process-group and application-group
# options to the WSGIScriptAlias directive.
